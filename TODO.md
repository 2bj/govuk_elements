==============

As this is prototype, there are a few things missing.

Here's a list:

Guidance

* Lightboxes
* Progressive disclosure


All pages

* Check page using a screenreader


Styles

* Box sizing fallback for old IE/check form styles

Examples

* Show inset text in forms
* Reduce padding for example boxes for tablet and below
* Add horizontal rule styles to show 'easy spacing'
