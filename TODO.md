govuk_elements
==============

As this is prototype, there are a few things missing.

Here's a list:

Guidance

* Lightboxes
* Progressive disclosure


All pages

* Check page using a screenreader


Styles

* Add 'selected' styles for radio buttons and checkboxes
* Add aria to form elements
* Box sizing fallback for old IE/check form styles

Examples

* Add JavaScript for grid example page
